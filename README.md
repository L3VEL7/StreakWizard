   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection URL (Railway will create this automatically if you add a PostgreSQL database)
6. Railway will automatically deploy your bot
7. To add a database:
   - Click "New" and select "Database"
   - Choose "PostgreSQL"
   - The `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically added to your environment variables

## Bot Setup

1. After adding the bot to your server:
   - Use `/setup` to configure trigger words (admin only)
   - Use `/setstreak_limit` to configure how often users can update their streaks (admin only)
     - Options: hourly, daily, or none (unlimited)
     - Important: Set this after configuring trigger words
   - Use `/remove` to remove specific trigger words (admin only)
   - Use `/leaderboard` to view rankings for each trigger word
   - Use `/help` to view all available commands
   - Users can start building streaks by sending messages that exactly match the trigger words
   - The bot will react with ðŸ”¥ to confirm streak increments

2. Example Setup:
   ```
   /setup words:daily,workout,study
   /setstreak_limit interval:daily
   /remove words:workout
